# utils
This is a repository for some little, nifty and useful Unix utilities that I
decided to develop for MSX. All of them are written in Turbo Pascal 3.0,
using libraries developed by [Kari Lammassaari](http://pascal.hansotten.com/delphi/turbo-pascal-on-cpm-msx-dos-and-ms-dos/) 
and by [PopolonY2K](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oldskooltech/). 
All the libraries are stripped to the minimum (MSX doesn't have plenty of RAM to
play with), they are in this repository and have the .INC extension in its
names.

# Version notes.
(c) 2020 Brazilian MSX Crew. Some rights reserved, but it's released due to
the GPL license, so... You know. Suggestions, corrections and upgrades are
welcome. But if you think that *all my work is garbage and I should learn Z80
Assembly because you think it's better*... GTH (Go To Hell). BTW, I'd send
your opinion to `/dev/null`.
